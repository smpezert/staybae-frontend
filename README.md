# staybae-frontend

Following the two day bootcamp building a front-end application in StayBae, the following
challenges have been created to further assess your understanding of React as well as the
application as a whole.

You are expected to attempt as many of the following challenges:

- [X] Ensure that the favourites can be selected from the Top Picks as well be removed from the
      favourite list (similar to the Property Details page).

- [X] Add the ability to remove items from the favourites list.

- [X] On the footer, create a link or amend the footer to add an ‘About Us’ page. Create a new about
      us page and add content to it. You must ensure you can navigate to it as well once it’s clicked.

- [X] Enhance the search results to render a map. For this, you will be required to use Google Maps.
      This will also require you to obtain a personal access token from the Google Developers portal.

- [X] Add more properties to the application and add their longitude/latitude (to show more markers
      on the map).

Bonus:

- [ ] Add places of interest on each property when you access the property details page. This can
      be achieved by using the longitude and latitude of the property and Google Maps for places of
      interest close to that.
